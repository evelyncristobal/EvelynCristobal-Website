        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Evelyn Cristobal, and I am currently a freshman undergraduate at the University of California Riverside. During my time here, I have been occupied with my studies while being involved at a club called UCR Healthy Campus, where I spend a few hours each week to look around UCRâ€™s campus for any cigarettes on the floor or current smokers. Although that is one of the organizations that Iâ€™ve joined here at campus, on weekends and breaks, I work at GAP at the Grove in Los Angeles, California. Originally, I am from Los Angeles, and as a very active city, I find myself to be just as active. One of my favorite things to do in my neighborhood is to speak on issues happening in my neighborhood and some actions we can do to reduce the impact. So I have become comfortable speaking in small and large audiences, as Iâ€™ve been doing this for 3 years now. Having a part time job for at least 2 years has taught me to balance well and manage my time. Not only that, but it has gotten over my shyness in approaching strangers and having a conversation with them. It has led me to find my areas of strength and weaknesses. For strengths, I have become very adaptable to the work environment, no matter what it is. I used to become very weak in reaching out if I ever have a question, but I learned to be more comfortable in it by realizing it only takes a few seconds to ask. <br><br>

        Overall, based on these experiences, I have learned to take a learning lesson from each of them. Such as getting over fears that I now consider small. Asking questions, approaching people, meeting new people, and getting put into nervous circumstances with very valued people. If there is something I learned in the experiences that I have done is that one could get put into an important situation with no warning in advance, so one should always be prepared and confident. At the end of the day, having confidence in the thing you do is key to doing well. All you need is a good state of mind and confidence in the knowledge you know, and one will look at things easier and smoother than those who do not consider themselves as very knowledgeable. <br><br>

        With this knowledge, I consider myself to be ready for new opportunities that come next. With experience in the retail industry which include sales, inventory, and becoming comfortable using various devices to get certain tasks done. I have become comfortable using applications that I have never heard of, or have used before, but needed to know to have a job in retail. These apps have taught me to listen attentively when given directions and work with the previous knowledge that I have based on my experiences. In the end, I have gotten the chance to work with different aspects in the world, which has built me enough background knowledge to prepare myself for my next job opportunity.
